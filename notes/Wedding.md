## Photos

The photos are really important, so we need to get a professional.  This includes the engagment pictures.  

## Reception

  The first think we will need to worry about is finding a venue.  Since our families aren't in Utah, we will need to find a place that does the decorations for us.  A few things that we will need to figure out for the reception include:
 
  * Food
    * When it comes to food, less is more.
    * Since our reception is small, we might be able to provide a small meal
  * Music - Nathan
  * Should we do dancing?
  * Do we want a dance party?
  * Do we want slide show?
  * How to leave the reception?

  We should also do tours 

## Wedding

  * Flowers
    * flowers for bride
    * flowers for brides maids
    * flower thingies for guys
  * You will need a dress
  * I will need a suit
  * Cake


## After Wedding (Things to get before we're married)

  * Get a mattres. DON'T GET A USED ONE!
  * Move things in to the apartment before the wedding
  * Birth Controll
    * Condums
      * These will probably be needed, even with other BCs
