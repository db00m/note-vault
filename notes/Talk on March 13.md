# Talk on March 13

#### Topic: Hope

## General Notes

* Lately I've had a hard time feeling hopeful about the world

* Ways we can lose hope, and how to combat them

* Hope that we will one day become the person we want to become

## Ways we can lose hope

With every thing that has been going on in the world, a lot has been on my mind. Having friends who served their missions in Ukrane and a boss who is from Belarus, I've been following the war in Ukrane very closely. Every time I read a new story about the situation, I am sadded by the loss, ditruction, and desitation that has plauged the Ukrainian people these past few weeks.  However, thier sad story is not one to be told over this pulpit in this sacred meeting, so I won't go into any more detail on thier situtation.  Thier situtation has led me to think about what I might say to the Ukrainian people if I was given the chance to speak to them.  How could I fill them with hope in such a hopless situation.  This oprotunity wil probably never come, but they are not the only people who need hope in this world.  The world we live in is a crazy place, and it's easy to get cought up in the hoplessness of it and become depressed.  The goal of my message today is to inspire myself—and hopefully all of you with me—to hope a little more and become a little happier.

To be honest, the main inspiration for my thoughts today didn't come from the scriptures or general conference talk.  A few weeks ago I was reading one of my favorite book of all time, _The Siver Chair_ by C. S. Lewis. For those of you that are unfamilary with C. S. Lewis and his works, _The Silver Chair_ is the fourth in the Chronicals of Narina series.  Near the end of the book, the main characters—Eustace, Jill, and Puddleglum—were trapped undground with the green lady.  In this scene, the green lady was using her magic to convice the heros that there was nothing in the world above them and the depressing undergound world they had fallen into was the only world that existed.  This depressed Eustace, Jill, and Pudleglum becuase the green lady had started to convince them that the Sun, the sky, Narnia, and every thing they loved was just in their heads.  Just before hope was lost, Puddleglum says something along the lines of this:
> "you won't make me forget Narnia; and the whole Overworld too. We'll never see it again, I shouldn't wonder. You mayhave blotted it out and turned it dark like this, for all I know. Nothing more likely. But I know I was there once. I've seen the sky full of stars. I've seen the sun coming up out of the sea of a morning and sinking behind the mountains at night. And I've seen him up in the midday sky when I couldn't look at him for brightness."


Puddleglum's inspiring words sparked a little hope in his friends, but this wasn't the end of their story.  We'll come back to them later.  

Haven't we all be burried in _underlands_ of our own before? So caught up in the darkness and despair in the world around us that we forget the light and joy that the Gosple of Jesus Christ can bring to our lives? Sometimes feelings like this can be brought on by the loss of a loved one, and sometimes by our own sins.  Regardless of what may causes us to forget the light, we are not alone.

One way that we can remember the light is by reading the scriptures.  Not only can we relate to the troubles that the charaters in the stories go through, but we can follow their example of how they found the light again.  Here are a few example:

#### Nephi

In the begining of 2 Nephi, Lehi dies, and Nephi is left alone to lead the people and deal with his rebelious brothers.  Like many of us would, Nephi felt discouraged by the sitation and his sins saying:

> 17. ...O wretched man that I am! Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.
> 18. I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily abeset me.
> 19. And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins..."
> ~ 2 Nephi 4

But Nephi had hope, showing as that if we have hope we can get through the greife of lossing loved ones and the sorrow that comes from our sins. Nephi continues:

> 19. ...nevertheless, I know in whom I have atrusted.
>
> 20. My God hath been my asupport; he hath led me through mine bafflictions in the wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep.
>
> 21. He hath filled me with his alove, even unto the bconsuming of my flesh.
>
> 22. He hath confounded mine aenemies, unto the causing of them to quake before me.
>
> 23. Behold, he hath heard my cry by day, and he hath given me aknowledge by bvisions in the night-time.
>
> 24. And by day have I waxed bold in mighty aprayer before him; yea, my voice have I sent up on high; and angels came down and ministered unto me.
>
> 25. And upon the wings of his Spirit hath my body been acarried away upon exceedingly high mountains. And mine eyes have beheld great things, yea, even too great for man; therefore I was bidden that I should not write them.
> ~ 2 Nephi 4

Although all was dark around Nephi, he remebered the light.  Notice how he also needed to remind him self.  It's easy to forget the light, so we need to constantly remind our selves of it.

#### Alma

Another example we can examine is the poor and aflicted people that Alma taught in Alma 32. They were "despised of all men because of there poverty" and probably felt very alone and mistreated.  As we know, these people had never even seen the light, but Alma showed them how it could bring them joy and happiness.  Another interesting aspect of this story is that Alma needs to convince them that this power is real, and he does this by teaching them how to hope.  We can learn a lot about hope from Alma 32, so I invite you all to read it when you get some time.

#### Jesus Christ

* Talk about the many examples of Christ lifting people out of darkness.

> "But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed."
> ~ Isaiah 53:5

> "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;"
> Isaiah 61:1

With out the Savior, it would be impossible for us to emerge from our personal _underlands_.  I invite you to think about the _underlands_ that you are feel trapped in as we discuss how we can be more like Puddleglum, and not hopeless despair over take us.

> Suppose we have only dreamed, or made up, all those things trees and grass and sun and moon and stars and Aslan himself. Suppose we  have. Then all I can say is that, in that case, the made-up things seem a good deal more important than the real ones. Suppose this black pit of a kingdom of yours is the only world. Well, it strikes me as a pretty poor one. And that's a funny thing, when you come to think of it. We're just babies making up a game, if you're right. But four babies playing a game can make a play-world which licks your real world hollow. That's why I'm going to stand by the play-world. I'm on Aslan's side even if there isn't any Aslan to lead it. I'm going to live as like a Narnian as I can even if there isn't any Narnia.

#### We need to be examples of hope

Artical of faith 13

* Living these principles will lead us to bring hope to many peoples lives.

### We can lose hope that we will one day become who we want to become

One _underland_ that I consistanly fall into is the underland of perfectionism.  It's difficult for me to hope that I can become perfect when I currentl feel so imperfect. Luckily for me, I am not alone in feeling this.  Moroni also had trouble with perfectionism.

This is how Moroni felt about his ablity to write the Book of Mormon:
> "the Gentiles will mock at these things, because of our weakness in writing"
> ~ Ether 12:23

Keep in mind that Moroni was alone, so when ever he uses the words "our", "us", or "we", he is talking about himself.  This lack of perfection is a little different from the the imperection that I feel, but the same principle applies to all imperfection, esspecially inperfections with sin. To relate this back to the story I told at the begging, lets image that perfection is the Overworld, and our current imperfection is equivilant to us being stuck in the the underland.  In a situation like this, it can be easy to think that perfection a dream and an illusion.  This is also our advisary want us to believe, but before we start beliving that there is no why out of this underland, lets read the Lords response to Moroni.  I'm sure many of you are familar with this scripture:

> "And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble them self before me; for if the humble themselves before me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them"
> ~ Ether 12:27

Do you have faith in this verse? Do you beilve the Lords promise? If not, I encouage to hope that this scripture is true.  Hope will lead to faith, and faith leads to miricals.  Don't belive me? Try it your self, follow Alma's council from Alma 32:27:

> But if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, andexercise a partical of faith, yea, even if can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you even untill ye brelieve in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words"
> ~ Alma 32:27

The reason why we can have this hope is becuase of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. In the latest General Conference, Elder Uchtdorf said these inspiring words:

> Because of God’s perfect love for us and the eternal sacrifice of Jesus Christ, our sins—both great and small—can be blotted out and remembered no more.6 We can stand before Him pure, worthy, and sanctified. 
> ~ Elder Uchtdorf

These words are so true! 

With out the Savor, we really would be stuck in the underland of despair with no escape.  So, lets talk more about how we build hope in the Savior.  I believe you will find all of these hope/faith build priciples very familar:

### 1. Prayer

Prayer can help us feel more hope because it reminds us that we are not alone.  When we pray, we can feel the presence of the Lord with us. This is essential because many of our hopeless feelings come from being alone



#### We can lose hope in the world and in humanity

Aother underland that we can get stuck in is believe that there is no hope for the world or humanity.  Today, it is far to common to joke about how the world is filled with horrable people who will always do horrible things and they will never change.  Is this true? Absolutly not! How would you feel if your whole existance was only judged only from the things you did wrong? This is how the world feels when you say there is no hope for it.

#### We can lose hope that what we belive is real and that we will never gain a testimony

#### Is hope just wishful thinking?

> **"The gospel is not part of our life, but our life is actually part of the gospel of Jesus Christ"**
> ~ Elder Wong

 > **"God is our Heavenly Father. He loves all of us. He knows our potential way better than we know ourselves"**
 > ~ Elder Wong

 > **"The only way to take sorrow out of death is to take love out of life"**
 > ~ President Nelson

 > "And what is it that ye shall ahope for? Behold I say unto you that ye shall have bhope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life ceternal, and this because of your faith in him according to the promise."
 > ~ Moroni 7:41
