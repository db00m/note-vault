## General Notes

* Sometimese history can make people fall asleep so we should make to history part apply to our lives.

* Start by taking about Moses and then connect it to the tabernalce and then to modern temples

* Fireside tonight is to help inspire the youth to participate in the tabernacle

* Tabernacle themed FHE (Bishop's Slide show?).  6th of June could be a good day.  Food will (should) be provided.
