# Situations

## we have a disabled child

## I lose my job

First and formost, we should prepare by saving.  As we've discussed we should save about 20% of our income. %5 for near emergencies, and %15 for retirement.  This should be pulled out after tithing and taxes but before anything else.

Our savings should sustain us while we find me a new job.  Rather than asking family members to help us with direct money, we should first ask if these family members have jobs for us.  Networking like this should hopfully help us to find a new job sooner.  

Worst case senario, we might both have to start working lower level jobs.  This isn't ideal becuase it would take us away from out family too much, and my even require the extensive use of babysitters.

## Justin needs to live with us

This would be an adventure, and I don't think it would be too dificult.  The two biggest concerns I have about this is privacy and money.  Taking care of another person will be expensive and will require a bigger apartment (esspecially while we are still in wymount).

Based on the situation, I think we should ask your parents for finacial help.  This of course depends on if your parents would be able to support us or not.  If they can't, let's turn to my parents.  I want to help your family as much as we can.

## we wreck the car

Based on how bad it is, this could leave us without a car for quite some time.  If this happens, we should save up for a new car and get around using public transit (luckily you're pretty good at that ðŸ˜‰).  Basicly, we shouldn't let not having a car stress us out.

This also means that we should depend on the car as little as possible.  Rather than driving every where we go, lets try and walk or use the bus.  Of course, this won't be possible for everything, but it will be better in the long run if we are not tried down by a car dependency.

## We have a kid earlier than we expect

I talked to your Dad a little bit about this durring our *"interview"*.  The main thought I have on this one is that we can't let it get in the way of our enducation.  Even if it requires us to take school slower, we should do eveything we can to finish it.  However, we shouldn't let that get in the way of taking care of our first child.  We should do every thing we can to build a comfortable life for our children

## We are unable to have kids

This might be a situation we need to talk about if it happens.  One thing to keep in mind is that adoption is always an option.

## We get called as mission leaders

This would be so awesome! Even if this never happens we should totally do a senior mission together!

## The city we live in gets attacted

I don't know what we would do in this situation.  Follow the prophet I guess, but that's not the most specific answer.

## There is a giant earthquake

## Our children get bullied

Do everything we can to protect them

## The school our children go to is terrable

## One of us is wrongly accused of criminal action

## I'm drafted

## The ecconomy crashes

## Our children hate us

## Some of our children leave the church

## Some our children come out as gay

## Some of our children commit crimes

## We have a "suprise" child (after having other children)
