Lately I've been troubled by the idea of Daily Repentence.  What does it mean to repent daily, and why is it even nessicary.  I don't think I sin every day, but then again maybe thinking that way is a sin.  While thinking about daily repentence, anthother question came to mind.  Am I okay with who I am?  Do I like who I am?  Most of the media I consume tells me that I should be okay with my self no matter who I am or what I do.  I should enjoy what i've become and let that be that.  That answer has never satified me though. I don't like this answer because I don't want to just be good.  I dont want to just be fine.  There's an aching to be something more.  That thought proccess takes me back to daily repentence, I so I thought I'd share with you what I've learned in my quest to become more than I am today.  First lets talk about what repentance is. Repentance begins with the Atonement of Jesus Christ.  This is becuase repentence is impossible with out the Atonment.  In short, the Justice of God requires that we perfect; however, living in a fallen world makes that impossible.

**Alma 34**
> **8** For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made. 

However, the Atonement is more than I "Band Aid" for our mistakes.
